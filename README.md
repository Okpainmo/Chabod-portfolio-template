# Chabod-portfolio-template.
# The Chabod story.
# what a readme file.
This is repo hosting Chabod - a single page portfolio template.
Project stack:
1. HTML5
2. Css3
3. Bootstrap 4.5
4. Vanilla JS (if needed)
5. Jquery (for use only by bootstrap and any other frameworks/libraries to be used. Every other JS requirements will be in Vanilla JS).
6. Migrating Chabod to Sass.
7. Chabod now on Sass.
8. Sorry, I changed my mind.....now using jquery + vanilla javscript for all extra chabod scripting work.
9. I've got great plans for Chabod.....building her bigger...thinking of selling her...don't tell anyone i told you so.
